Automatic Number Plate Recognition(ANPR)
Our ANPR project focuses on building an intelligent system capable of automatically detecting and recognizing vehicle license plates from images or videos. It will involve image preprocessing, license plate detection, character segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR). The goal is to create an accurate and efficient solution applicable in areas such as traffic management, parking systems, and law enforcement, addressing challenges like varying plate designs and lighting conditions.

Training the custom dataset for the required information which is the number plate, using the tensorflow object detection. Finally using EasyOCR python package we will be getting our desired output from the region of interest.
